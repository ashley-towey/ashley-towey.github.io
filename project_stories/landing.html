<h1>Stories for the Road</h1>
<p>Stories for the Road is a speculative tool for cyclists to be able share Recommendations, Encouragements, and Stories at a specific location. This tool serves as a proposal for the possible ways in which we could use technology to foster community within cycling by taking back ownership of the roads. Select your device, click through other peopleâ€™s submissions, and then contribute by adding your own. </p>

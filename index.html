      <h1>Visual Thinking</h1>
        <p>
          Visual Thinking shows the collective effort of Information & Systems Stage 2 students exploring alternative ways of displaying information. The work shown is a product of five weeks of designing and conceptualizing. Through group discussions, we were able to push the boundaries by challenging what it means to communicate visually. 
This process began by investigating and displaying daily activities which then became more focused toward an individual topic. Despite everyone’s outcomes being vastly different in both content and visual approach, we as editors were able to arrange them into four sections that follow a narrative sequence. Routine, Movement, Perception and Identity. 
Whilst we have arbitrarily separated each individual project into sections, they all exist within the same space. What unites us is our focus toward producing images that work, whether that be to instruct, inform or explore. We invite you to read this publication as a narrative - from front to back - or to jump right in and engage with a specific project. Regardless of how you engage with this publication it will exist as a record of our collective thoughts on visual thinking.

    SLATE

    <p> 
      Creating a product will help to solidify this intention and be a consolidation of the visual language. This will take the form of a 3D tile based experience involving arranging activities in the order of your morning or evening routine. In order to officially launch the semiotic language which I have created, it needed a brand under which to operate. This is where SLATE comes in. The name is symbolic of taking each day as it comes, and offers the user a fresh slate from which to communicate their routine. It is key that the brand produces kinaesthetic experiences, and they should feel very tactile in order to maintain engagement. In particular this will be helpful for people with various levels of additional needs to communicate with their carers, guardians and family.
